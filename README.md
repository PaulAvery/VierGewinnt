# VierGewinnt (Match Four) - A school project
This project is created for a school assignment. Therefore it is my first foray into C# and "game" programming in general.

It is simply an implementation of the popular game match four on the commandline.

I decided to take the route of completely overengineering everything (especially rendering). Mainly because I was bored.

Pass at least two player names as CLI arguments.

Documentation (including class diagrams) can be created by running `doxygen` inside the project directory.
